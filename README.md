# Documentation 📝.

A simple python based game using turtle for the graphical interface.

## Why I created this?? 🤔

I am learning graphical implementation of python and c++. earlier I have created a Tic tac toe game using MatLab and now I am creating this to understand the fundamentals of turtle.

You can also watch my other funny turtle-based drawing by clicking [here.](https://github.com/aayushkumar20/AI-based-Python-projects/tree/main/funny%20python%20projects)

### Hope you'll like it 🙂.
